## Thread safety in const member functions

Let's look at a sample C++ class:

```cpp
class NetworkPacket{
  public:
  NetworkPacket();
  void* getByteOffset() const;
};
```

Any const member function gets a `const` `this` pointer as an argument. That means that we really cannot change any class state inside these type of functions. Well, sought off. C++ always has a workaround.

Enter `mutable`.

### mutable keyword

It is a special keyword which when used in the context of class member variables mean that their value can be mutatated inside a `const` function.

Example:

```cpp
class NetworkPacket{
 private:
    mutable size_t numBytes = 0;
  public:
  NetworkPacket();
  void* getByteOffset() const{
      numBytes += 1; // VALID: Compiler will not complain
  }
};
```

### Multithreading with const

With the introduction of mutable, multithreading becomes a little tricky now. Earlier, we were guaranteed that any queries to `getByteOffset` will not change it's state since it is a const function.

Now things look quite different. Multiple threads will now `mutate` the value of `numBytes` and we need to be extremely careful.

We have a number of options:

1. We can employ a `std::mutex`

The modified class looks like:

```cpp
class NetworkPacket{
 private:
    mutable std::mutex m;
    mutable size_t numBytes = 0;
  public:
  NetworkPacket();
  void* getByteOffset() const{
      std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
      numBytes += 1; // VALID: Compiler will not complain
  }
};
```

This will work but the downside is that now `NetworkPacket` can only be moved since `std::mutex` does not permit copying.

2. We can employ a `std::atomic`

The modified class looks like:

```cpp
class NetworkPacket{
 private:
    mutable std::atomic<unsigned> numBytes{0};
  public:
  NetworkPacket();
  void* getByteOffset() const{
      ++numBytes;
  }
};
```

This is lightweight and easier to implement than a `mutex`.

Like a `mutex`, a `std::atomic` also makes a class `move` only.

> Be careful with multiple variables defined as `std::atomic`. That makes it more tricky to synchronize stuff. A `std::mutex` should be preferred in those cases.

I kept this blog nice and short. Hope you learned something out of it.
